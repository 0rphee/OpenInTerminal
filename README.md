You are asked to set the default terminal to open after first launch.

The selection box will not appear after you have set the default terminal. If you want to reset the default terminal, please enter the following command in the terminal. Then just run the application again.

For **version 0.3.0**:

>  ‚ö†Ô∏è macOS will ask your permissions to access Finder and Terminal (iTerm or Hyper) when you run the app for the first time. Please give the application permissions.

### If you are using Dark Mode

I provided several icons along with the app in the [release](https://github.com/Ji4n1ng/OpenInTerminal/releases). You can right click on the app and select `Get Info`. Drag the icon to cover the default icon.

## Todo üë®‚Äçüíª

- Drop down menu in `FinderSync Extension`  ‚úÖ By [Camji55](https://github.com/Camji55)
- `Preferences` panel which can allow users to set up to open new windows or new tabs.
- Open in `VSCode` / `Atom` / `Sublime`? (This needs discussion)
- Supporting keyboard shortcuts

- ~~Dynamically change icon depending on Dark Mode.~~

If you have a good idea, welcome to open a new `issue` .

## FAQ ‚ùì

#### 1. I accidentally clicked on the `Don't Allow`  button.

You can run the following command in the terminal. This will reset the permissions in the System Preferences.

```
tccutil reset AppleEvents
```

#### 2. Special character in the `path`.

`Terminal` supports all special characters. However `iTerm` and `Hyper` do not support backslash `\` and double quotes `"` in the path.

## Changes üóí
